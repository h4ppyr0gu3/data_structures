# Data Structures

Following the accompanying PDF which you can also find [here](https://www.cs.bham.ac.uk/~jxb/DSA/dsa.pdf), Thanks to University of Burmingham who made this pdf accessible, I implemented the following data structures in C:

- linked list
- queue
- doubly linked list
- stack
- [ ] binary tree
- [ ] hash
- [ ] heap

As well as searching and sorting algorithms

- [ ] linear search
- [ ] binary search
- [ ] bubble sort
- [ ] quick sort
